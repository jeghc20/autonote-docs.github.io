To include a citation in your page you can use the command below:

{% highlight liquid %}
{% raw %}
{% include citation text="Your citation goes here."%}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

These are what the citations look like {% include citation text="They're inspired by what-if.xkcd.com"%}. When you click on them a pop-up with the text appears {% include citation text="Just like this!"%}. A list of citations is then made at the bottom of each page {% include citation text="This is to make AutoNOTE as accessible as possible."%}.
